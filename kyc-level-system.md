# KYC Level System

Metapad's KYC Level System follows **consensus-based approvals** between the applicant and the KYC reviewer role. The leveling system is consists of 4 levels/tiers. These levels are applied on an in order basis.

From project owner's perspective, this is where they prove smart contracts and project ownership, establish more trust credibility scores to their users, and add more integrity to their projects.

For users, this tiering can be a guide to get informed and understand more about the project's smart contracts cans and risks.

Below are the levels/tiers list. The example is collected from https://testnet.metapad.dev/token/3.
