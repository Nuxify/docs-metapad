# For Project Owners

To get started, you can try this guide in Metapad [Testnet](https://testnet.metapad.dev) before creating your actual production-grade project.

Below are the ordered steps starting from application to upgrading your KYC levels.

!!!
Interaction with Metapad are on-chain operations. Hence, you need some Matic to pay the gas fees (very cheap) and the review fee.
!!!

### Step 1: Mission Application

To enlist a project, visit https://testnet.metapad.dev/enlist/ (Testnet).

Fill-up the required forms and submit transaction. You should have some Matic for gas fees.

Project owner can cancel the mission application by clicking the **Cancel** button and approve the transaction.
!!!

Once accepted, you can see the project in the home page. Click the newly minted token to redirect and see more info.

For editing token info, project owner will submit transaction and is up for review by the KYC reviewer.

Same for transferring Metapad token ownership.

### Step 3: Contract Notes

Project owner can apply for KYC Level 2. Fees varies from contract to contract so make sure you have enough Matic funds in your wallet.
