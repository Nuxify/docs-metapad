# For Project Owners

To get started, you can try this guide in Metapad [Testnet](https://testnet.metapad.dev) before creating your actual production-grade project.

Below are the ordered steps starting from application to upgrading your KYC levels.

!!!
Interaction with Metapad are via on-chain transactions. Hence, you need some Matic to pay the gas fees (very cheap) and the review fee.
!!!

### Step 1: Mission Application

To enlist a project, visit https://testnet.metapad.dev/enlist/ (Testnet).

Fill-up the required forms and submit transaction. You should have some Matic for gas fees.

!!! danger
There should be a section in your website (we recommend in the footer section) where the contract addresses should be visible.

The number and the exact contract addresses from the application form should match the declared contract addresses in the website. This will be captured by the Web Archive Wayback Machine.

Not doing so will automatically reject your application.
!!!

You can visit this demo website at https://webapp-metapad-client-demo.pages.dev/.

!!! danger
The contracts should also be verified in blockchain explorers (Etherscan, Blockscout, or the likes).

If not, the contracts repository should be publicized so we can check and calculate the bytecodes to a specific git commit.

The smart contract should be publicized for transparency. Not doing so will automatically reject your application.
!!!

![Check Mission Application Status page](/static/guides/project-owner-2.png)

!!!
Project owner can cancel the mission application by clicking the **Cancel** button and approve the transaction.
!!!

Once accepted, you can see the project in the home page. Click the newly minted token to redirect and see more info.

### Step 2: Token Info and Transferrability

Once in, you can see the token information, edit KYC Level 1 info, Metapad KYC badge, and transferrability option.

!!!
For editing token info, project owner will submit transaction and is up for review by the KYC reviewer.

Same for transferring Metapad token ownership.
!!!

### Step 3: Contract Notes

Project owner can apply for KYC Level 2. Fees varies from contract to contract so make sure you have enough Matic funds in your wallet.

### Step 4: Contract Audits

Project owner can apply for KYC Level 3. Fees varies from contract to contract so make sure you have enough Matic funds in your wallet.

When uploading contract audits from other auditing company, be sure to upload the generated report with reference as the contract reviewer will double check it.

Project owner can also request an audit from the Metapad team. Hit us at hello@nuxify.tech

### Step 5: Crews

Project owner can apply for KYC Level 4. It is a requirement to attach a verified LinkedIn account for each user.

For the team video, it is a requirement that the video camera feed will be on, and the listed crews should be also there in the video. Participants in the video meeting will be speaking the following:

- Name
- Position/Role on the project
